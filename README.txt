CS349 Assignment 2, By Yundi Huang

How to use the application:
1.First you start with a gray origin in the middle, you can't draw with gray colour.

2.To draw a polyline, single click on the Origin Circle to switch colour.

3.Click on a polyline to select it.

4.Drag the selected polyline away or close to the Origin Circle to scale the polyline larger or smaller,respectively.

5.Drag the selected polyline clockwise to rotate and create circular instances of the original polyline. The smaller the angle,the more instances you create. You can only rotate polylines clockwise. If you try to rotate it counter clockwise,the polyline will still rotate clockwise.

6.Remember you can only do scale and rotate when you actually press on the selected polyline.

7.To change the colour of a polyline, first select it, and press down your mouse on the black background (where no polylines is drawn). Then drag your mouse around the Origin Circle, you will see the Origin is changing colour, So is the current selected polyline, and your next polylines.

8.To scale the thickness of a polyline, first select it, and press down your mouse on the black background (where no polylines is drawn).Then drag your mouse towards the Origin or away from the Origin, your selected polyline will grow thicker or slimmer,respectively.

9.To reset the thickness, double click on the black background.

 

Enhancement:
1. Scale thickness by dragging toward or away from the Origin.
2. Change colour by dragging around the Origin.
3. Get back to the starting stroke thickness which is 3.0f by just simply double click on the black background.

Explain:
   I just want to keep the user interface extremely simply and easy, So I decided not to use widgets and buttons. Instead of widgets and buttons, you can just use simple dragging and pressing to change colour and change stroke thickness.
